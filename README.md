This is a little demo of some basic transformations of openGL
using pyglet.

You can just run the icosahedron.py file directly or if you want to
install it instead on the system path run `python setup.py install`.

The script requires the pyglet package to be installed.

The program displays an icosahedron approximation to a sphere.

To move the sphere around just drag the mouse with the primary button.

To rotate hold shift while dragging.

To cycle through the predefined light sources press L.

To cycle through the predefined sphere materials press M.

To reset the scene to the original state press R.
